	<p><font face="Arial Narrow">The dolls used for Operation Titanic were nicknamed Rupert by British troops and Oscar by American</font>.<font face="Times">[2] The official name was "Device Camouflage No. 15"</font>. <font face="Courier">They were made of burlap and filled with straw or green waste. Some were found in a warehouse on an old British airfield in the 1980s</font>.<font face="Candara">Some of the original dolls from this find are now exhibited in war museums</font>.<font face="Optima"> The dolls are immobile and about 85 cm tall, consequently smaller than a person, but on the ground during twilight it is difficult to discern the difference between them and real parachutists</font>.<font color="green"> In addition, real parachutists would hang motionless from their parachutes during the jump, so that the ground troops could not discern them from real jumpers or comrades who had been shot while airborne</font>.</p>
