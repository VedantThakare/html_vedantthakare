	<b>FORCE</b>
</dt>
<dd>
	Force is the push or pull on an object that is caused by an interaction with another object. It can change the position, speed, or state of an object, and can stop a moving object, move an object from rest, or change the direction of its motion. Force is an external agent that has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.

	<b>VELOCITY</b>
</dt>
<dd>
	Velocity is quickness of motion or action. A synonym is celerity; a simpler word is speed. In physics, velocity specifically refers to the measurement of the rate and direction of change in position of an object.

	<b>DENSITY</b>
</dt>
<dd>
	In physics, density is the ratio of mass to volume, or mass per unit volume. It's a measure of how tightly a material is packed together. The formula for density is D = m/v, where D is density, m is mass, and v is volume. The symbol most often used for density is the lowercase Greek letter rho (œÅ), although the Latin letter D can also be used.
